""" The ultimate guide to write a good function in python:
    1. Do one thing and do it well.
    2. Separate commands from queries.
    3. Only request information you actually need.
    4. Keep the number of parameters minimal.
    5. Don't create and use an object in the same place.
    6. Don't use flag arguments.
    7. Remember that functions are object.
    Bonus: Follow the naming convention and the style guide of your language.
